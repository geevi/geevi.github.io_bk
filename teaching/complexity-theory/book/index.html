<p>
You have seen algorithms for a variety of problems. This begs the question
of <em>whether there is an algorithm for any  given a problem?</em>. 
Furthermore <em>is there an efficient 
algorithm for all problems?</em>. Even if you have an algorithm for the problem, 
<em>can it be made more efficient?</em>. This course will be addressing these 
questions. For answering these questions, we first need to define:

<ol>
   <li> What is a <em>problem</em>?</li>
   <li> What is computer/programing language, where you can execute/write 
      the algorithms?</li>
   <li> What do you mean by <em>efficient</em>?</li>
</ol>

We will start with very simplified definitions for these questions and 
try to find the answers for this setting.

<h1 id="___sec1">Decision Problems </h1>

<p>
Typically the output of an algorithm could be a graph, a number etc. 
But we will consider only problems with an YES or NO answer. Furthermore,
we will define the problem to be just the set of all YES-instances. 
You are familiar with this definition from your automata theory class. 
For example take the REACHABILITY problem where the input is \( (G(V,E), s,t) \)
where \( s,t \in V \), and the problem is whether there is a path from \( s \) to 
\( t \). So we will define the problem itself as the set of instances \( (G,s,t) \)
where a path exists.

$$
\mbox{REACHABILITY} = \{ (G,s,t) : \mbox{ there is a path in $G$ from } s \mbox{ to } t \}
$$

<p>
The number of instances of graphs having a particular number of vertices \( n \) 
is finite. But the set of all instances is the union of such instances with
\( n=1 \) to \( \infty \). Hence each instance has a <em>size</em> \( n \) which is the 
number of vertices in the graph. Size of an instance is a fundamental concept,
and we will be defining it for all the instances. Later we will see, that size
plays an important role in defining what we mean by an efficient algorithm.

<p>
It was easy to define REACHABILITY because the original problem had an YES or
NO answer. But can we write problems for which the outputs are numbers, as 
decision problems? Lets consider the the problem of finding the <em>chromatic 
number</em> of a graph. Chromatic number of a graph \( G \) is the minimum number of
distinct colors required to color a graph such that for every edge, end points
are of different colors. Note that for a graph on \( n \) vertices, the chromatic number is \( \leq n \).

<p>
The descision version of the chromatic number problem  takes the graph \( G \) and a number \( k \) between \( 1 \) and \( n \) as input. The output is YES, if the chromatic number is \( \leq K \). So 

$$
\text{CHROMATIC-NUMBER} = \{ (G,k) : \text{ chromatic number of graph } G \text{ is } \leq k \}
$$

<p>
Suppose you have an algorithm that takes \( T(n) \) steps for deciding the CHROMATIC-NUMBER problem, 
you can find the chromatic number also. For this we will create \( n \) instances of CHROMATIC-NUMBER
from the input graphs, setting \( k=1 \) to \( n \). Note that these instances will transition from NO-instances
to YES-instance and remain YES-instances. The chromatic number is the least \( k \) for which the instance
is an YES-instance. Hence you have algorithm which takes \( n\times T(n) \) steps for finding the exact 
chromatic number.

<p>
 <div class='problem'>
                <b>Problem 1: </b> Can you find a algorithm, which takes \( (\log n) T(n) \) steps?

<p>
</div>

<h1 id="___sec2">Turing Machines </h1>

<p>
The simplfied model for computer/programming language will be the Turning Machine (TM).
The Turing Machine has many tapes (which is similar to the hard disk in 
a modern computer) and a limited set of states (which is similar to the RAM or the cache).
There is a read-only input tape, where the input is written and a write-only output
tape where the output is expected when machine is finished. There is also multiple
work tapes, which can be used for storing intermediate results in the computation.
The work tapes are assumed to be of infinite length. This is needed because as 
the size of the input instances becomes larger, the intermediate memory also needs to 
be large. The set of states of the TM is fixed and does not change with input size.

<p>
The input is assumed to be a string from a finite alphabet \( \Sigma \). A tape cell
can store an additional blank symbol indicating that it is unused.

<p>
The algorithm is implemented in a TM by means of a state function. The state
function takes as arguments:

<ol>
   <li> the symbol under the heads of the TM in each of the tapes,</li> 
   <li> well as the current state</li> 
</ol>

and returns 

<ol>
   <li> the next state</li>
   <li> the symbols to be written under each of the work tape heads</li>
   <li> the directions to move each of the heads one cell to the left, right or not move.</li>
</ol>

Now we define a TM using mathematical notation. \( \Sigma \) is the alphabet 
in which input and work tape is written (for eg. binary ie. \( \Sigma = \{0,1\} \)). 
The blank symbol for unwritten tape cell is \( \_ \). 
Let \( \Omega \) be the set of states of the TM. There are 2 special states of the
TM called \( \omega_{\text{start}} \) and \( \omega_{\text{stop}} \) called the start
and the stop states. The state transition function is denoted by 
$$
\delta : \Omega \times \Sigma \cup \{ \_ \} \rightarrow \Omega \times \Sigma^k \times \{ < , > , - \}^{k+2}
$$

<p>
Now lets see an example of a TM for solving the following problem:
$$
PALINDROMES = \{ x \in \{0,1\}^n : x \text{ is a palindrome}\}
$$

<p>
First lets try to write a pseudo code for a TM solving the problem:

<ol>
   <li> Copy the input in to the second tape</li> 
   <li> Move the head in the input tape to end and second tape to begining</li>
   <li> Compare each bit by moving the input head from end to beggining and second head from beggining to end</li>
   <li> If any bit is different reject</li>
   <li> If all bits match accept</li>
</ol>

We will use a turing machine simulator for implementing this. 
See the example : <a href="http://turingmachinesimulator.com/shared/oihvkhvacu" target="_self"><tt>http://turingmachinesimulator.com/shared/oihvkhvacu</tt></a>

<p>
Note that it is extremely tedious to write algorithms as a TM. Neverthless, all the 
algorithms can be written as TM.
 <div class='problem'>
                <b>Problem 2: </b> Design a TM which decides the language :
$$
DIV5 = \{ x \in \{0,1\}^n : x \text{ is binary number divisible by } 5\}
$$

<p>
Write the program first as a pseudo code and then in the format in <a href="https://turingmachinesimulator.com/." target="_self"><tt>https://turingmachinesimulator.com/.</tt></a>
