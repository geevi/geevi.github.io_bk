### Complexity Theory
<span style="display: block; padding-bottom: 10px; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; font-weight: 300;
border-bottom: gray 1px dotted;">
Complexity theory studies what problems can and cannot be solved by computers given limited running time and memory resources.

Students are expected to read the corresponding chapter from the textbook (mentioned under readings), before attending the lecture. 
The lecture is mainly for clearing doubts and covering the most confusing parts.
