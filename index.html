       We show that
assuming a version of UGC, given a (almost) $3$-colorable graph, no efficient algorithm can find a $2^{poly(\log \log n)}$-coloring. This is 
an improvement over $C=poly(\log \log n)$ hardness result of Dinur and Shinkar, using similar assumtions.

      For the problem of $C$-coloring a $4$-colorable $4$-uniform hypergraph,
       we show that no efficient algorithm can guarantee $C=2^{(\log n)^{1/19}}$, an improvement over $C=poly(\log n)$. First the result was shown for a super-polylogarithmic $C$. Subsequently Subhash Khot and Rishi Saket proved a result for $C=2^{(\log n)^{1/18}}$, but only for $12$-uniform hypergraphs. I observed that by combining the methods, the same result can be obtained for $4$-colorable $4$-uniform hypergraphs.

    The covering number of a CSP instance, is the gv-smallest number of assignments
  to the variables, such that each constraint is
  satisfied by at least one of the assignments. We show the following
  results:  
  <br/> - Assuming a covering unique games conjecture, introduced by Dinur and Kol, we show that it is hard to approximate the covering number within any constant factor. Our
    generalization yields a complete characterization of CSPs over
    constant sized alphabet $\Sigma$ that are hard to cover since CSPs
    over odd predicates are trivially coverable with $|\Sigma|$
    assignments.   <br/> - For a large class of predicates that are contained in the
    $2k$-LIN predicate, we show that it is quasi-NP-hard to
    distinguish between instances which have covering number at most
    two and covering number at least $\Omega(\log\log n)$. This
    generalizes the $4$-LIN result of Dinur and Kol that states it
    is quasi-NP-hard to distinguish between $4$-LIN-CSP instances
    which have covering number at most two and covering number at
    least $\Omega(\log \log\log n)$.

Traditional game theory assumes that the players in the game are aware of the rules of the game. However, in practice, often the players are unaware or have only partial knowledge about the game they are playing. They may also have knowledge that other players have only partial knowledge of the game they are playing, which they can try to exploit. We present a novel mathematical formulation of such games. We make use of Kripke semantics, which are a way to keep track of what different players know and do not know about the world. We propose a notion of equilibrium for such games, and show that equilibrium always exists.

Physarum or slime
mold is a fungi. Researchers observed that it
 has fascinating computational capabilities like solving a
maze, even without a central coordination mechanism. They
modeled the creature grown in a maze with food at end points, as a
flow of fluid over a graph of tubes, with time varying diameters.
Simulations of this model revealed that the diameters of tubes along
the shortest paths converged to 1 and the rest to 0.  We prove these convergence results formally for all graphs. We
used tools from electrical network and network flow theory
 to show exponential rate of convergence for a large class of
graphs.

Streaming algorithms are motivated by
situations where the input data is huge and is read in an online
fashion. The efficiency of algorithms is measured with respect to the
space used. We study streaming algorithms for checking whether an
input string(of length $n$) can be parsed in a fixed context free
grammar. Even for simple grammars, one can prove that deterministic
algorithms cannot do anything better than storing the entire input.
Using the technique of fingerprinting, we gave a randomized
streaming algorithm that uses only $\log n$ space, for a sub-class
of context free grammars. We also showed that for simple
grammars outside this class, any
randomized algorithm will require $\Omega(n)$ space. Furthermore we gave an $O(\log n)$ space
randomized streaming algorithm for checking degree sequence of a
graphs (where $n$ is the number of vertices), and prove that it is
optimal in its space usage.
